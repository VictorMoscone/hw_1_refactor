# 01 Victor Moscone's Horiseon HW1

## Absolutely Refactored

**A quick description**: Hey there and welcome to my test application for Horiseon.

This is a simple front-facing application that focuses on applying the basics of HTML and CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing layout for a professional business.

Without JavaScript, functionality is low, however; if I could spend more time on this application - I could easily design different subdomains for the nav bar to link to. 

The question then becomes, what to fill each subdomain with? That's information that my client would need to provide me. By creating multiple subdomains, I open up *a lot* of space for additional information.

## Setup Instruction

```
1. Clone the repro to your desktop.
2. Launch index.html.
